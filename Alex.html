		<p>Hello, I am Alex Mallick a computer science major at Graceland University. I was born in a small town in India and did my high schooling there.
		I always had an attraction for computers since my childhood and always wondered how such rectangular objects can do such mighty calculation 
		this lead me to take CSIT as my major. But the another thing that also attracted me was that me being a social media user and then realizing that
		how much CSIT is involved in these daily applications. Since then i was much interested in applications development and creating apps which
		benefits the society.
		</p>
		<p>Apart from CSIT, I love maths and physics. I am  a huge fan of Calculus specially with integration. I think physics and maths should be
		a thing that human civilization should always give importance to and always modify and upgrade it. I also have huge respects to the works of 
		Einstein and Stephen Hawking. I also think that Astro physics is one of the most interesting field of study in this present generation and
		I am a huge believer of outer terrestrial life and also about bending the time travel.</p>
