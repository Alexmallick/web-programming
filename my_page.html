		<div>life is an amazing and the most expensive gift given to man kind. But sadly not all are able to realize 
		this wonderful gift. According to the statistics around 45000 americans alone die due to suicide. This is a vast number
		of deaths and compared to car accidents it is 5000 more deaths.</div><div>Now we should be thinking what can be main causes of this deaths.
		There is a lot of discussion on this but one of the 
		main reason is the mental health of the person and how could they be able to deal with the frustrations and ups
		and downs in life. So seeing this we can easily suggest that one of the effective way to deal with this is to create
		mental health centers which constantly hears the emotional pains and the frustrations of the people. As the saying goes if 
		you share the feelings you share the pain as well, which makes you feel much lighter.</div><div>To deal with 
		frustrations one should sense the positive energy from themselves and the surroundings around them. We should
		recognize the gift of life and also recognize its ways.Life is a process. Trust it.
		The day-to-day, hour-to-hour happenings taking place in your life may appear completely unrelated on the surface, but in truth,
		there is an orchestrated, interlocking chain of events occurring. 
		The human in us always wants to know what is going on and why, but we don’t always need to know!
		Even in times of major upheaval and turmoil, understand that it is part of a necessary process,
		and after the dust settles, the gift will reveal itself. Live life and find the best of it. </div>
		<div>Here are some of the ways to deal with frustrations and come out of it:-
		<ul><li>Ask Yourself, “What Is Working in This Situation?”</li>
			<li>Keep an Accomplishments log to remind you of your success.</li>
			<li>Focus On What You Want to Happen.</li>
			<li>Remove the “Noise” and Simplify your surroundings.</li>
		</ul></div>
